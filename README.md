# Mini_Project-on-Stackor-Queue
Write a program that randomly stores 10 integer numbers (to start with) in a LinkedList object.  Using this LinkedList object, implement stack and queue operations using GUI as follows: Add 2 Radio Buttons for choosing options (a) Stack and (b) Queue, and 4 JButtons (Push, Popfor Stack, and Add, Deletefor Queue).Once you run the program, it should display a LinkedList of 10 random integers in a text field. You should then be able to choose a radio button of either Stackor Queue, followed by one of its operations (Push or Pop Buttons for Stack ONLY, and Add or Delete Buttons for Queue ONLY (Invalid choices like choosing Stack followed by pressing ADD button should not work).  The program should then display the modified list ( as per the operation undertaken) in the text field. Note:In case you think you may not be able to implement the GUI, then use JOptionPaneto enter your commands (as shown below), and show the resultant Linked List in the console.    The commands to be entered in showInputDialogue will be as follows: Push Pop  Add Delete
